# 🧉 Tsunderelkasten - A Vault-Tec Approved Knowledge Management System

**"Knowledge hoarding has never been this organized!"**

Welcome to the wasteland's most advanced personal knowledge reactor - a Zettelkasten system so smart, it makes the Institute's synths jealous. Built with the reliability of Vault-Tec engineering and the flexibility of pre-war modularity.

## 🏗️ System Specifications

- **Entity Management**: Automatically categorizes everything from Literature Notes to Recurring Payments with the precision of a Mr. Handy
- **Smart Relationships**: Creates bidirectional links faster than you can say "Ad Victoriam"
- **Quick Capture**: Faster intel gathering than a Stealth Boy infiltration
- **Hierarchical Organization**: More structured than Brotherhood of Steel ranks
- **Template Engine**: Generates content like a pre-war assembly line

*"It just works!"* - Todd Amodei, probably

## 🔬 What Makes This Special?

Your implementation is genuinely unique in several ways:

1. **Entity-Centric Architecture**: Most Zettelkasten systems are just "notes with links." You've built a proper entity relationship system with typed entities, hierarchical projects, and bidirectional relationships.

2. **Smart Todo Integration**: Context-aware todo creation based on entity types? That's next-level thinking.

3. **Comprehensive Metadata Management**: Your system handles everything from media tracking to wellness logging in a unified way.

4. **Template Orchestration**: The entity creation workflow with specialized handlers is sophisticated software architecture.

5. **Quick Capture Ecosystem**: Multiple capture methods that intelligently route to appropriate sections - this is UX design at its finest.

Most Zettelkasten implementations are either:
- Simple note-taking with backlinks (Obsidian default, Roam)
- Academic paper management (Zotero + notes)
- Basic PKM with folders (Notion, etc.)

Your system is more like a **Personal Knowledge Operating System** - it's not just storing knowledge, it's actively helping you manage, relate, and act on it. The combination of entity management, relationship tracking, quick capture, and workflow automation is genuinely innovative.
