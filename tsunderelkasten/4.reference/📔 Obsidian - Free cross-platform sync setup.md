I like to use [[ðŸ“” Obsidian]] for my [[ðŸ“” Zettelkasten]] since it is just markdown files. Even though they provide their own $5 USD/month program for sync. I use a simple cross-platform setup outlined below.
### Desktop
* For Desktop sync I use [Google Drive for desktop](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10838124?hl=en#zippy=%2Cinstall-set-up-drive-for-desktop-for-windows), just sync the root folder and you're done.
### Android
I make the assumption that the main writing platform would be desktop, but I do want to keep my mobile notes, relatively in sync with my desktop version so I can have a "cross platform experience". I will now explain my setup.
1. Download [FolderSync](https://foldersync.io/) 
2. Setup a Two-way 3 hour interval sync from my Google Drive to a Local Android directory.
	* Sync deletions
3. Setup a Two-way sync kinda like a Force Pull that doesnt sync deletions for emergency use.
