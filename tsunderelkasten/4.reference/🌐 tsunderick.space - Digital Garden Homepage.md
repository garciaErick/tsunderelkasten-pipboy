### 🧉 Keep it Simple
# 🌱 My Digital Garden

Welcome to my little corner of the internet—a living, breathing collection of notes, ideas, and reflections cultivated through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). This isn’t a blog or a static site; it’s a **digital garden** where thoughts grow, connect, and evolve over time.

> *"A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust."*  
> — Gertrude Jekyll

## 🌟 What’s Here?

- **Knowledge Base**: Notes on topics I’ve dug into, from tech to philosophy.
