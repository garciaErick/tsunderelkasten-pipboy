## Note Types
### Definitions
#### 1. Fleeting Notes
These are short, spontaneous ideas or thoughts that come to mind. They are often quickly jotted down without too much structure and serve as temporary notes. The goal is to capture ideas immediately so you can process or discard them later. These notes are not intended to be kept permanently but are a way to capture inspiration or thoughts on the go.
##### Types of fleeting Notes
- **Daily**: Notes or observations captured daily.
- **Weekly**: Summarized or reflective notes from the week.
- **Monthly**: Highlights and learnings from the month.
- **Yearly**: Annual reflections or summaries.
#### 2. Literature Notes
- **Purpose**: Notes taken from books, articles, podcasts, or videos.
##### Types of Literature Notes
- Key quotes
- Summaries
- Personal insights or critiques
#### 3. Permanent Notes
- Purpose: Refined, long-term notes based on fleeting or literature notes.
- Should represent actionable knowledge or ideas.
- Example: A note titled "Principles of Flexibility Training."
#### 4. Reference Notes
- Purpose: Store raw data, links, or reference material without personal interpretation.
- Example: A YouTube link for a flexibility split tutorial.
#### 5. Structured Notes
- Purpose: Organize specific projects or goals into a clear structure.
- Example: "Flexibility Goals" could serve as a structured note where you:
    - Define your goals.
    - Track progress.
    - Link related notes like "Split Flexibility Techniques."
