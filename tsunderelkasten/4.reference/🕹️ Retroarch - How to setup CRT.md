## Windows
Create a custom resolution 640x480 progressive. And put up a 4:3 video make sure you dont get black bars on the sides
## Emulator
If you usually play with shaders you have to disable and change some settings, a CRT does not need a CRT filter:
* enabled interlaced in video output
* disable crt shader
* disable on screen overlay
