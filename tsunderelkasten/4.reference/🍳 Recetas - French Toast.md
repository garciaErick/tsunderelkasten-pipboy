## Ingredients 
* Challah bread, 8 slices, each 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick (sub with brioche or texas toast) 
* 6 large eggs
* 120g (1/2c packed) brown sugar
* 5g (1t) vanilla extract
* 2g (1/2t) cinnamon
* 6g (1t) salt
* 2g (1/8t) nutmeg
* 450g (2c) half and half
* Neutral oil
* Butter (for cooking) 
* Maple syrup
* Powdered sugar
* Whipped butter (2g salt + 230g/2 sticks softened butter)
## Instructions
1. Slice the challah bread into 8 slices, each 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick. 
2. Place the bread slices on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Dry the bread in a 180¬∞F (82¬∞C) oven for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through. Alternatively, leave the bread out overnight to dry.
3. To make the custard, in a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. 
4. Once combined, add half and half and whisk until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous.
5. Pour half of the custard into a shallow baking dish or half-sheet tray to soak the bread
6. For challah: Place 2 slices of bread into the custard, soaking for 2 minutes on each side. The custard should be about ‚Öì of the way up the sides of the bread
For brioche: Soak each slice for 30 seconds per side.
For Texas toast: Soak each slice for 1 minute per side.
7. Move soaked pieces to a plate once soaked while you get ready to cook the French toast
8.  Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add a generous swirl of neutral oil followed by 1 tablespoon of butter.
9. Once the butter is melted and the pan is evenly coated, place the soaked bread slices in the pan. Cook for 4 minutes on the first side, moving the slices around occasionally to ensure even browning.
10. Flip the slices and cook for an additional 4 minutes on the second side, again moving them to avoid uneven browning.
11. To prepare the whipped butter, add softened butter and 2g salt to a stand mixer with the paddle 12. attachment and whip until butter is whipped into fluffy soft peaks
12. To serve, stack the cooked French toast slices on a plate. Top with a dollop of salted whipped butter and a generous drizzle of dark maple syrup. Optionally, dust with powdered sugar.
