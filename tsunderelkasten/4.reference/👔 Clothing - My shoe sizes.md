## Vivobarefoot
I usually use a 42 EU/ 9 US
## Carets
* Oxfords: 9 US
* Derby Boots: 9US
## Shamma Sandals
* Shamma Warriors: 8.5 US
	* With this ones I had a discussion with CHATGPT and recommended these instead since the differences from open and closed-laced shoes. It seems my shoe size is actually 8.5 however these other brands didnt offer half sizes at the time
## Earth Runners
I use a 8US for these shoes, these are awesome and to me way better than shamma sandals, I am still keeping shamma for going to the gym and sauna sessions.

## Regular shoes 
9 US
