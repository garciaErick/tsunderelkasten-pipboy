These are some items I want to keep for reference in my personal notes
## Outlier NYC - Pants
* [OUTLIER â€“ Futurehighdarts](https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futurehighdarts?): High waisted travel pants, enough said ^06626a
* [OUTLIER â€“ Loose Dungarees](https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/loose-dungarees)
* [OUTLIER â€“ Futurecorps](https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/futurecorps): Hardcore corporate attire. A workwear cut upgraded for a 21st century workplace and 22nd century commute. The hard stretch waistband is snug and comfortable, with a matte black shank front closure and discreet dime pocket in the rear. The hardwearing and breathable Futurecloth is clean, comfortable and ready to take things outside or up the ladder, either way the future is yours.
* [OUTLIER â€“ Injected Linen Pants](https://outlier.nyc/collections/pants/injected-linen-pants)


## Outlier NYC - Shirts 
* [OUTLIER â€“ Cottonweight Merino Cut Two T-shirt](https://outlier.nyc/collections/shirts/cottonweight-merino-cut-two-t-shirt): The best of both worlds in a broad shouldered t-shirt. Organic cotton on the outside with natural merino performance against the skin. Merino and cotton take dye differently creating a depth of color and tone no single fiber can provide, plus itâ€™s very soft, warm and cozy.
	* 49% Merino
	* 46% Cotton
	* 5% Nylon
