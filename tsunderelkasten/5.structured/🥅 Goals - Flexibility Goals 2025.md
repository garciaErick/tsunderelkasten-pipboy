## To keep in mind
1. To be flexible you need at least **5 minutes a week of stretching.**
2. These **5 minutes** are best optimized in **30 second stretches**
3. This means you can do either:

|                           | **Routine 1**                                    | **Routine 2**                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Weekly Sessions**       | 4                                                | 2                                             |
| **Stretches Per Session** | 10 (2 sets × 5 exercises)                        | 25 (5 sets × 5 exercises)                     |
| **Weekly Total Time**     | 20 minutes                                       | 25 minutes                                    |
| **Intensity**             | Moderate (shorter, more frequent sessions)       | Higher (longer, fewer sessions)               |
| **Best For**              | Building consistent habits and gradual progress. | Maximizing effort in fewer, focused sessions. |
|                           |                                                  |                                               |
