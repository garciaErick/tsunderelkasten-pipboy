## üîë Key Insights, Quotes & Timestamps
1. **Heat wok to Leidenfrost point** - Heat empty wok until water droplets dance and evaporate quickly
2. **Add sufficient oil** - Pour enough oil to completely cover the bottom of the wok
3. **Set to highest heat (9)** - Turn heat to maximum and wait for oil to start smoking (2-3 minutes)
4. **Reduce to lowest heat when smoking** - As soon as you see smoke, immediately turn to lowest setting
5. **Let smoke gently for 15-30 seconds** - Allow oil to continue smoking gently, then ready to cook

## üìù Notes
*Additional thoughts, follow-up questions, areas to explore*
- Re-season before each cooking session (stainless steel loses seasoning easily)
- Use more oil rather than less for better coverage
- Wait for clear visible smoke before reducing heat
- Seasoning is invisible on stainless steel (no brown patina needed)
- Adjust heat as needed for cooking after seasoning is complete
