## 🗂️ Relevant tasks and notes
If you want a full breakdown of the current pending tasks, head over to [[📔 Tasks - Pending tasks listing]]
### ⏰ Pending tasks <%dateUtils.relevantDateLabel%>
These are tasks that are due/scheduled in the current date range
```dataview
TASK
WHERE !completed
  AND !contains(file.path, "birthdays") 
  AND !contains(file.path, "templates") 
  AND !contains(tags, "#todo/dailyQuest")
  AND text != ""
  AND !regexmatch("^⏳ ?\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$", text)
  AND (
    (scheduled >= date("<%dateUtils.startDate%>") AND scheduled <= date("<%dateUtils.endDate%>")) 
    OR (due >= date("<%dateUtils.startDate%>") AND due <= date("<%dateUtils.endDate%>"))
  )
FLATTEN choice(contains(text, "🔺"), 0,
		   choice(contains(text, "⏫"), 1,
				  choice(contains(text, "🔼"), 2,
						 choice(contains(text, "🔽"), 4,
								choice(contains(text, "⏬"), 5, 3))))) AS priorityNumber
SORT priorityNumber ASC, due ASC
```
### ⚠️ Overdue tasks <%dateUtils.relevantDateLabel%>
These are tasks that are overdue, meaning the due/scheduled date was before the current date range
```dataview
TASK
WHERE !completed
  AND !contains(file.path, "birthdays")
  AND !contains(file.path, "templates")
  AND !contains(tags, "#todo/dailyQuest")
  AND text != ""
  AND !regexmatch("^⏳ ?\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$", text)
  AND (
    (scheduled AND scheduled < date("<%dateUtils.startDate%>") AND (!due OR due < date("<%dateUtils.startDate%>")))
    OR (due AND due < date("<%dateUtils.startDate%>"))
  )
  AND (due OR scheduled)
FLATTEN choice(contains(text, "🔺"), 0,
		   choice(contains(text, "⏫"), 1,
				  choice(contains(text, "🔼"), 2,
						 choice(contains(text, "🔽"), 4,
								choice(contains(text, "⏬"), 5, 3))))) AS priorityNumber
SORT priorityNumber ASC, due ASC
```
### ✅ Tasks completed <%dateUtils.relevantDateLabel%>
Congratulate yourself for a job well done. These are the tasks completed within the date range.
```dataview

  AND !contains(file.path, "templates") 
  AND !contains(tags, "#todo/dailyQuest")
  AND text != ""
  AND (completion >= date(<%dateUtils.startDate%>) AND completion <= date(<%dateUtils.endDate%>)) 
GROUP BY file.link
```

### 📌 Notes created <%dateUtils.relevantDateLabel%>
The DataView query below looks for notes created today
```dataview
List FROM "" 
WHERE file.cday >= date(<%dateUtils.startDate%>) AND file.cday <= date(<%dateUtils.endDate%>)
SORT file.ctime asc
```
### 📌 Notes last touched <%dateUtils.relevantDateLabel%>
The DataView query below looks for notes last updated today
```dataview
List FROM "" 
WHERE file.mday >= date(<%dateUtils.startDate%>) AND file.mday <= date(<%dateUtils.endDate%>)
SORT file.mtime asc
